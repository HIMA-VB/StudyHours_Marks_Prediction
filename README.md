# Linear Regression and Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing linear regression and data analysis on a dataset. The dataset contains information about the number of hours a student studied and their corresponding exam scores.

## Contents

1. **Data Exploration:**
    - The code loads the dataset, checks its shape, data types, and missing values, and provides summary statistics.

2. **Data Visualization:**
    - It includes visualizations such as a scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and exam scores and a heatmap showing the correlation between dataset columns.

3. **Linear Regression Model:**
    - The code builds a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits the model to the training data, and makes predictions.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - The code evaluates the linear regression model's accuracy and calculates the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for both the training and testing sets.

5. **Predictions:**
    - The code provides predictions for scores based on the number of study hours, allowing you to input custom values.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd linear-regression-analysis
   ```

3. Run the Python script to perform linear regression and data analysis:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression_analysis.py
   ```

4. View the results and visualizations in the script's output.
